					<h1 class="page-title">The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo</h1>
				</header>
				<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Gtdd76ck/Creation-of-Adam-Painting-Michelangelo.webp" with="500" height="300">
				<p>It portrays more than the artist's bold point of view – it is no wonder that the painting, even while placed next to the Creation of Eve and the Congregation of the Waters, still makes the most famous section of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. In Michelangelo's time, most painters created their art in one specific way. Creation scenes were a common subject, but the Creation of Adam broke the boundaries that were set in the field of art and went out of the ordinary. Dominating the picture is a figure of God and a figure of Adam.</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>This picture, in a sense, depicts more than the creation of the first man, in fact, it shows the very start of what would later become the human race. Adam's figure is curved as he stretches out to God, taking one's mind to the idea that man is made in the likeness of God himself. The way the two dominant figures relate and correspond to each other, one can almost see the closeness that Adam has with his creator. Michelangelo made the Creation of Adam in such a way that the figure of Adam echoes the figure of God, almost as if one is nothing but an extension of the other.God's form, in turn, is stretched out to reach Adam. However, God appears to be in some suspended imperceptible shape that houses him and other angelic figures. The angels within Michelangelo's frame differ from the typical impression of angels in that they do not have wings. These angels hold up the support that God is painted upon, and there appears to be some drapery whipping out in their background. In this figure, God's form has been made clear, almost as if he were human. He is elderly, but even with his long grey hair and equally long beard, his body is masculine and somewhat youthful.</p>
				<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The Creation of Adam stretches for over 500 square metres on the ceiling. It has more than 300 figures.

This fresco is sectioned in themes according to the Book of Genesis.

There is God’s Creation of the Earth; God’s Creation of Humankind and their fall from God’s grace and the state of Humanity as represented by Noah and his family.

Other famous paintings alongside the Creation of Adam on the ceiling are Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the Deluge, the Prophet Jeremiah and the Cumaean Sibyl.</font><br></blockquote>
                                <h4>Michelangelo's Depiction of God</h4>
				<p>Compared to the imperial images of God that other artist had painted before, it is clear that Michelangelo took a bold step with this piece. God has always been thought of as a majestic and all-powerful ruler of mankind. One would expect such a personality to be painted wearing royal garments and such, but Michelangelo reduces him to a simple old man in a simple light tunic with most of his limbs exposed. This image puts a question in one's mind – what if this is the face of God? It is an intimate portrayal of his being. God is shown to be accessible, touchable, and close to his creation as his figure forms a convex shape to reach out to Adam.</p>
				<h5>The Meaning of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam</h5>
				<p>The obvious meaning of this painting has everything to do with the creation of man and the start of the human race, but looking deeper, this painting is about the relationship that the creator has forged with his creation. By simply stretching out his arms, God creates Adam and points out the Christ child as Adam's saviour. Here, the creator is truly all knowing. He is about to bestow Adam with everything that he will need, but God has already seen the fall of man after temptation from the devil. He, therefore, anticipates this fall and presents a ready solution through Christ.
But there is still a big grey area in this picture – are Adam and God letting go of each other or are they reaching out to each other? The way their fingers are painted, it is hard to tell if God and man satisfy their mutual desire to co-exist or if the two are separating and man is going off to live an independent life. Observing the form of Adam, we see that he is relaxed. This could be interpreted to mean that although he is alive, he is still lifeless. He is, therefore, reaching out to God to receive that one component that separates man from every other beast that roams the fields. As for God, he looks rather focused. His figure appears active like he is hard at work to make his creation perfect. So it would, therefore, make sense to conclude that the figures are reaching out to each other in a union and they are not separating from each other.
Even geographers have interpreted this painting to be similar to two landmasses joined by a narrow strip but separated by a huge canal. Scientists have analysed the picture to symbolise the birth of mankind, drawing their hypothesis from the red backdrop which they interpreted to be a human uterine mantle with the green scarf symbolising an umbilical cord that has been recently cut.
All these interpretations, more or less, point to the same thing. But why did Michelangelo make the hands in that way? Why not make them meet? It is frustrating to think about it. This one detail is the entire reason this painting is famous. The space between the two fingers is a little under an inch, but this gap makes the entire picture worth a second and a third look. Even with the conclusions that have been made about the meaning of this painting, it is still very enigmatic. Looking closer, one is inclined to see what is not there – inclined to feel the force that seems to exist between the two fingers. It is like an electric charge, and as the picture sinks into the mind, there exists some realisation that makes an observer aware of the importance that the painting holds. This is the very start, one wrong move and humanity would have taken a completely different path. There is the concept of delicacy involved, and the way God is focused on the task at hand, one can almost tell that he aims only for perfection and nothing less.
It gets more interesting when one imagines the two fingers touching. Oh, what Adam must have felt like the touch of immortality made its way into his very soul. Michelangelo captures what the church has been trying to explain to its followers for centuries – he captured the divine spark of life. He captured the proof that God and man are nothing if not the perfect image of one another. Michelangelo, through the Creation of Adam, silently presents the past, the present, and the future of humanity in one frame. One can say that this image was made at the very beginning of time, for what it shows is incredible. To the simple eye, it is simply a picture of two figures reaching out to each other, but look closer and that simple moment before the finger of God breathes life into the finger of Adam becomes the essence of everything we know and believe.
The painting glorifies God in a number of ways. The fact that he starts an entire race of people by a simple touch of a finger should be enough to establish his place as the all mighty, but Michelangelo takes it even further. God does not have to touch Adam for an observer to feel the power, the strength, and the life transferring from one finger, across the gap, and into the other finger. In its right, this painting deserves all the acknowledgement it gets. There is another angle to this. For those who have seen the title of the painting and know the story of creation, it is easy to make conclusions, but for those that have never heard of Michelangelo or his work, it becomes a little difficult to know what the Creation of Adam is about. Looking at the painting from such a perspective, there is no spark between the fingers, there is no Christ child, and there is certainly nothing related to the birth of mankind. All there is to this painting are two figures inclined towards one another.</p>
