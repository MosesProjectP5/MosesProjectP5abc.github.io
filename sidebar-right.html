				<p>The subject of the Last Supper was a popular choice for the refectory walls of monasteries and convents in 15th-century Italy, whereby nuns and monks could have their meals in the presence of Jesus’ final repast. Leonardo’s version appears neatly arranged, with Jesus at the centre of an extensive table and the Apostles to his left and right. He wears the traditional red and blue robes and has a beard, but Leonardo did not imbue him with the customary halo. Some scholars have proposed that the light from the window behind him serves this role or that the implied lines of the pediment above the window create the illusion of a halo. Other scholars have argued that the missing attribute may also suggest that Jesus is still a human being, who, as such, will endure the pain and suffering of the Passion.</p>
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>The wall painting was commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, the duke of Milan and Leonardo’s patron during his first extended stay in that city. The Sforza coats of arms appear with the family’s initials on the three lunettes above the mural. Leonardo likely began working on the painting in 1495 and, as was his manner, worked slowly with long pauses between sessions, until he finished in 1498. Because of Leonardo’s notorious perfectionism, true fresco painting was not ideal, as the process requires that an artist apply paint quickly to each day’s fresh plaster before the plaster dries and bonds the pigment to the wall. Instead, Leonardo tried an experimental technique using tempera or oil paint on two layers of dry preparatory ground. His compromised process meant that the pigments were not permanently attached to the wall, however, and the painting began to flake within a few years. It continued to deteriorate, suffering from the steam and smoke of the monastery’s kitchen, soot from the refectory’s candles, and the dampness of the location.
In the ensuing centuries, the painting sustained additional damage. In 1652 a door was cut into the north wall, removing Jesus’ feet and loosening the paint and plaster. Several restorations followed, with heavy-handed retouches and the application of varnish, glue, solvents, and the like. The painting endured additional irreverence when Napoleon’s invading troops used the refectory as a stable. After a flood in the beginning of the 19th century, mold growth damaged the painting further still. During World War II the painting suffered its greatest catastrophe, when an Allied bomb caused the roof and one wall of the refectory to collapse. The painting survived, but it was exposed to the elements for several months before the space was rebuilt.
After centuries of maltreatment, the Last Supper underwent an extensive and controversial 20-year restoration that was completed in 1999. Restorers worked in small sections to remove previous retouches, layers of grime, and coats of varnish while adding beige watercolour to the parts that could not be recovered. When the restored painting was revealed, many critics argued that the restorers had removed so much of the painting that very little was left of Leonardo’s original work. Others, however, commended the recovery of such details as the Apostles’ expressions and the food on the table.</p>
				<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The painting, despite restoration efforts, remains fragile, so, in an effort to slow its deterioration, visitors are allotted 15 minutes to view the mural in small groups. Although some of Leonardo’s celebrated artistic qualities—luminous colour, soft modeling, and studied facial expressions—have been lost, viewers can still witness his skill in depicting a sequential narrative, his considered approach to creating an illusion of space, and his interest in representing human psychology in expression, gesture, and posture. Since the Last Supper’s completion, when it was declared a masterpiece, the mural has garnered the praise of such artists as Rembrandt van Rijn and Peter Paul Rubens and such writers as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. It has also inspired countless reproductions, interpretations, conspiracy theories, and works of fiction. The Last Supper’s delicate condition has not lessened the painting’s appeal; instead, it has become part of the artwork’s legacy.</font><br></blockquote>
				<p>The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci is undoubtedly one of the most interesting attractions in the city of Milan. The availability of tickets is very limited, so the advance reservation is considered "mandatory". Tickets to see this masterpiece can be booked online but must be sold as part of a package, so it is recommended to combine them with a Milan Audioguide, or with entries for the Brera Gallery or for the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana.

Naturally, it is also possible to book a guided tour that may also include visiting other churches or attractions located in the center of Milan.

It is also possible to request a visit with a private guide that includes, in addition to the entrance to the Last Supper, a visit to the adjacent Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie.</p>
