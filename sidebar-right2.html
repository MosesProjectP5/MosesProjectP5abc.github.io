				<p>We have all seen Raphael’s wonderful fresco ‘The School of Athens’ at least once. The most fortunate have been able to admire it live in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican Museum. But why has its value remained unchanged over the centuries? What is “The School of Athens” really about?</p>
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>This work, dating from the early 16th century, celebrates human knowledge and the conquest of beauty. At the height of the Renaissance, Pope Julius II commissioned Raphael to depict a scene set in the classical world to indicate the roots of Roman civilisation. These same roots lie in the ancient Athenian culture, the first real example in the West of structured philosophy reflected in humanity.
The fresco, framed by a painted arch, depicts the most famous philosophers and mathematicians of antiquity conversing with each other like a group of friends, interweaving scientific and humanistic culture into a single body of knowledge.
All 58 are in an imaginary classical building represented in perspective, communicating the universal values of Beauty, Goodness and Truth.
In the centre we see Aristotle and Plato, the latter with his finger pointing towards the Hyperuranium, the world of ideas where Goodness and Beauty reside. To the sides and around the other 56 figures: 28 on the left and 28 on the right.
It is very interesting how the number 28 is used by the Divine Painter in “The School of Athens”.  The number 28 is in fact a universal number that encapsulates the movement of life in the world. Just think of the lunar cycle, the tides, the epigenetic cycle of cells, or the hormonal cycle, all of which have 28 days. I dare say that this is a number linked to Beauty and its continuous and cyclical becoming. It is the number of the Beauty of life, of the renewal of cycles. These natural times and processes are also innate in man and, by respecting them, he becomes a perfect being in harmony with his surroundings. The geometry in which the figures are arranged symbolises Raphael’s confidence in the order of the world, a divine and intellectual order.</p>
                                <blockquote>The School of Athens is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate tondo containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: "Seek Knowledge of Causes", "Divine Inspiration", "Knowledge of Things Divine" (Disputa), "To Each What Is Due". Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify philosophy, poetry (including music), theology, and justice.[4][5] The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the painting is actually philosophy, or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, "Causarum Cognitio", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo Aristotle's emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in Metaphysics Book I and Physics Book II. Indeed, Plato and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, many of the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' monad. </blockquote>
